						<h3>Elementary &amp; Middle School</h3>
						<p>
							For students in elementary and middle schools, Ivy Ambitions focuses on discovering and developing interests, strengthening 
							the English language, accelerating in math and science, and cultivating soft skills. Rather than focusing on college preparation, 
							we focus on life and career preparation. Since many children at this age have not discovered their strengths and interests, it is 
							a patient process. Interests cultivated should be sustainable over a number of years and need not be expensive. Cultivating soft 
							skills starting at this age places the child ahead of most others by the time they graduate from high school. In fact, the 
							foundation laid at this stage lends to less need for guidance in high school.
						</p>
						<p>Here is a breakdown of our process:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Discover</strong>: strengths, interests, personality</li>
							<li><strong>Enrich</strong>: focusing on English, Math, Technology, other interests and study and test taking skills</li>
							<li><strong>Soft Skills</strong>: public speaking, community service, competitions, interpersonal skills</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br />
